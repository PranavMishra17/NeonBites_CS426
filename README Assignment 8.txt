Alpha Release notes: 
During the Alpha release testing, three rounds were conducted with testers Franco, Ahmed, and Hal. Common feedback included the need for clearer instructions on gameplay mechanics, such as navigating with NPCs and using bikes, as well as confusion about combat mechanics. Testers appreciated the visual design and customization options but suggested improvements in UI clarity and control responsiveness. Overall, testers engaged with various aspects of the game, highlighting the potential for further refinement in gameplay mechanics and user experience.

For the Beta release, we planned to implement several key updates and features:

Shader Effects: Three shaders were assigned to highlight objects, create arrow effects, and enhance visuals.
Time Limit: A time limit feature was proposed to add urgency and challenge to gameplay.
Complete Level Design: Enhancements to the map and level design were planned, including more buildings and obstacles.
AI Cars: AI-controlled cars were proposed to add dynamism and obstacles to the game world.
Menu System: Both main and pause menus were scheduled for implementation to improve user experience and accessibility.
Instruction Text: Clear instructions and indicators for combat and item pickup were intended to enhance player guidance.
Health System Improvements: Implementations such as slowing down the player at lower health and adding health regeneration items were planned.


ASSIGNMENT 8:
In the Beta Release, we successfully implemented the following updates:

Map and Level Updates: The map and level were enriched with additional buildings and obstacles.
Mission Selecting UI: A phone UI for mission selection was added to provide a more immersive experience.
Tutorial Integration: A tutorial was incorporated into the game as a semi-level to aid new players.
Customization Scene Enhancements: The customization scene received significant improvements for a more engaging experience.
Game Menu: A comprehensive game menu was added, providing controls and options to start the game or access the tutorial.
Pause Menu: A pause menu was integrated into the game to allow players to pause and resume gameplay seamlessly.
NPC Interaction Improvements: NPC interaction was enhanced with additional cameras and improved dialogue mechanics.
Credits and Introductory Text: Credits and introductory text were added to the game for a more polished and professional presentation.
Scene Linking: All scenes were properly linked, ensuring smooth navigation and progression throughout the game.

Overall, the Beta Release marks significant progress in implementing planned features and enhancing the overall gameplay experience.

SHADERS:

The addition of shaders serves to enhance visual feedback and player guidance within the game.

1. Black & White Shader for Locked Items: By applying a black & white shader to locked items, players can easily distinguish between accessible and inaccessible objects, streamlining navigation and decision-making.

2. Highlight Shader for Delivery Object: The highlight shader applied to the delivery object draws attention to its significance, aiding players in identifying and interacting with key objectives in the game. This visual cue reinforces the importance of the delivery task and improves overall gameplay clarity.

3. Arrow Shader for Directional Guidance: The arrow shader provides directional guidance to players, particularly when locating important items or objectives. By outlining the arrow in a darker yellow color and filling it with a lighter shade, players can easily discern the direction they need to follow, facilitating smoother navigation and progression through the game world.
PS: Please refer to the addded screenshot in the esign document for this shader. We were unable to merge this work in our build in time.

In summary, the implementation of these shaders addresses the need for clear visual cues, assisting players in understanding game mechanics, identifying objectives, and navigating the game environment more effectively.
